# Research dark patterns in games
## Introduction
I am doing this research to get a better understanding of how dark patterns are implemented in games, in order to use that knowledge to design a mobile game which uses dark patterns. The mobile game is intended to use dark patterns to get people to perform health activities. 
Firstly, it’s important to know what dark patterns are and which types of dark patterns exist. Dark patterns exist both inside and outside of the game design field and both will be discussed.
“A gaming dark pattern is something that is deliberately added to a game to cause an unwanted negative experience for the player with a positive outcome for the game developer.” - DarkPattern.games » Healthy Gaming « Avoid Addictive Dark Patterns 
“Deceptive patterns (also known as “dark patterns”) are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something.” - Deceptive Patterns (aka Dark Patterns) - spreading awareness since 2010 
Above are two definitions of dark pattern; the top one is about dark patterns in games and the bottom one is about dark patterns in general.
The different types of dark patterns that exist will be explored in the results.

## Context
The mobile game is a medieval action game about clearing levels to progress. Each level is centred around one mission. Clearing the level gives the player coins, which they can use to upgrade their weapons. 
I want to add dark patterns, because I want as much engagement as possible from players. I also want players to keep coming back to play the game. Both these points are important, because the game will eventually be testing if people will engage longer with a health platform. 

## Approach
I first did a general Google search wherein I discovered a website about documenting dark patterns in games. Then I did a more specific search on Google scholar, in order to find credible sources on dark patterns in games. For research purposes, I searched for dark patterns in games, because that is what I actually needed. 
After reading through sources, I selected 4 papers and began reading them, marking things as I went along. One of these papers actually used data gotten from the website about dark patterns in games.
After having read and marked all 4 papers, I noted down some overlapping information. This was mostly about terminology and types of dark patterns. 

## Results
Dark patterns in games are implemented through sophisticated combinations of psychological manipulation and technical design. There are 4 primary categories of implementation:
1.	Temporal Manipulation
   
•	“Playing by appointment” mechanics that force daily returns

•	“Grinding” systems that extend playtime

•	Time-based limitations on gameplay 

2.	Monetary Manipulation
   
•	Complex currency conversion systems with varying rates

•	“Pay to skip” mechanics for tedious gameplay

•	Hidden costs and comparison prevention

3.	Social Manipulation
   
•	Social pyramid schemes

•	Guild obligations

•	Friend spam and impersonation

4.	Psychological Manipulation
   
•	Exploitation of sunk cost fallacy

•	Variable rewards systems

•	Loss disguised as win (LDW) mechanics

These 4 categories are also referred to as the 4 types of dark patterns. Some research linked the use of dark patterns to the greed of companies, with game developers having their hands tied. Other state that dark patterns could simply be the result of being “stumbled upon” and working to increase sales, thus the reason to keep using them.
However you spin it, the way dark patterns emerged isn’t the most important thing; it’s the reason why they are still being used that’s important. On this the research states that serious research and testing on dark patterns is extremely scarce. As such there are still a lot of grey areas. One of these grey areas is about using dark patterns for healthier purposes. If a pattern can be considered dark, because it’s without the user’s consent. Then it’s easy to say that games should always be transparent with the use of these patterns. But it also came to light in these researches that dark patterns become less effective, if users know about them. This can negatively impact the good intentions of some games. If the use of a pattern (that is to the benefit of the user; like encouraging the user to perform health activities) becomes less effective if the user is aware of said pattern, is it necessary to inform the user? And would you consider that a dark pattern, because the user ends up being manipulated without their consent?
All these questions are important when talking about dark patterns, but are not what I will focus on. This is because this research is mostly about learning how dark patterns are incorporated into games and how to implement them.

## Conclusion
Steps to take when deciding what dark patterns to implement and how to implement them. First step, what to consider:
1.	Ethical Considerations
   
•	Consider the potential impact on vulnerable populations

•	Evaluate the manipulation level of each pattern

•	Balance business goals with player wellbeing

2.	Implementation Guidelines
   
•	Start with minimal implementation and monitor effects

•	Consider the game's target audience

•	Maintain transparency in monetization systems

3.	Alternative Approaches
   
•	Focus on core gameplay value rather than manipulation

•	Implement clear pricing and currency systems

•	Provide meaningful choices rather than forced decisions

4.	Monitoring and Adjustment
   
•	Regularly assess player feedback

•	Monitor spending patterns

•	Adjust systems based on player behaviour and satisfaction

The research emphasizes that while dark patterns are widespread in the gaming industry, developers should prioritize ethical considerations and player wellbeing in their implementation. The goal should be to create engaging experiences through meaningful gameplay rather than manipulation. These considerations however, aren’t what I need to concern myself with.
My goal is to make a game that uses dark pattern (in order to get the user to perform health activities). The reason why the last part of that goal is in brackets, is because that is the ultimate goal. What I will create (and thus should be focussed on) is the creation of a game that has dark patterns implemented.
When deciding what dark patterns to use in your game, you should consider what it is that you want to get out of the user. What is it that you want the user to spend? If it’s time, then look into temporal dark patterns. If it’s money, then look into monetary dark patterns. If you want to get more people to join the game, consider social dark patterns. And if you want to shackle users to your game, consider psychological dark patterns.
After that decision, consider what dark patterns you want to incorporate. You can do this by looking at all dark patterns that fall under your chosen type. Or you can do some game analysis on games that have some desirable mechanics.

## Advice
Because real currency will get replaced by health activities in my game, I chose to look at monetary dark patterns. And since I also want users to spend enough time in-game, I also chose to look at temporal dark patterns.
The main game I analysed was “Bullet Echo!”, because it has the same genre and perspective as my game will have. This game has mechanics such as; daily rewards, grinding, infinite treadmill, pay-to-win, gambling and loot boxes. These mechanics are implementations of temporal and monetary dark patterns. They are also effective in this game, because of the fact that it has a large active player base and is one of the best reviewed action games in the Play store.
