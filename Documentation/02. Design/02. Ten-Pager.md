### Characters
The player, a mercenary who gets hired for different missions. The enemies, mostly knights or other people (depending on the mission).

### Art style
2D pixel art with bird view top-down perspective. 

### Target audience
General public, mostly those who would use the Gamebus platform. Mostly aiming for people between the ages of 18 to 35 years.

## Gameplay design
Important to consider
dark patterns need to be incorporated. Mobile design, so not too many confusing UI elements.

### Core loop
-> create character build -> play level -> complete mission -> get new items ->

### Aesthetics
Challenge as primary aesthetic with submission at a later stage due to grinding.

### Mechanics
Rules: Failing to clear a mission means the reward gets smaller.

Resources: weapons (bows, swords, spears, etc.) and overview of the mission beforehand (via mission posters).

Actions (outside levels): Character building, clearing quests and buying items. 

Actions (inside levels): attack, walk, (sneak and block/dodge).

### Platform
mobile WebGL

### Controls
joystick on the left for movement and other in-level actions with buttons on the right. 

### Levels

Tile maps will be used for all levels.

Levels should be designed with medieval/castle architecture in mind. For example: the layout in level 2 in inspired by the image in the bottom right corner, as seen in below image.

Above are the designs for two of the scenes, the dashboard and the character builder.

This is the initial design for the character builder menu.

This is the general UI layout of each level. There is a joystick on the left and an attack button on the right. In future there can be a “switch” button added for when a player can select two weapons.

### Desired playtime
max 5 min per level, with multiple levels per play session (daily lives).

### Sound effects
attack, walk, block/dodge (confirmation for the player), button presses in menus and start/end of levels.

### Flow/Difficulty
Levels will get progressively more difficult with different mission types. This ensures that there is always something to do at the players current difficulty level.

### Player feedback
Players will receive mostly visual feedback; when an enemy/the player is hit (via health bar going down + blinking effect on player), when a mission is cleared/has failed. 

### Feedback loops
The player is rewarded when completing a mission with in-game currency. This can be used to buy different/better weapons in the shop.

## Bonus material
The game can be expanded upon by adding more weapons, levels and enemies. There can also be different eras to explore outside of a medieval setting.
