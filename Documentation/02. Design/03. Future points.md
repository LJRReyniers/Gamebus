Adding more weapons can help make combat more complex. Above image shows some examples that could be added.
Make sure all weapons can be historically linked to the medieval era.

Weapons should be categorised based on type of weapon. Ea: slash, shot, blunt, stab, protect/deflect.
All weapons from the same type can use the same animation, thus lessening workload.

Animations should change to be 2 seperate sprites untop of each other: 1 character attack animation of the weapon type and 1 of the correct weapon sprite.

Weapons can also be designed to have permenent upgrates. 
Think about stat boosts or elemental attacks (see WARNING), but should function more as percentage increases.

For example: if a player upgrates the attack power stat of their sword, than that sword has a higher percentage chance of performing a more powerfull attack.

## Enemies
There need te be more enemies/enemy types added to the game. 
The fun is "challenge", but right now the combat is too simple to achieve that.
Enemies should also be able to carry weapons, thus creating more varied combat, because each weapon has different fighting styles.

## Missions
More mission types can be added, like: assasinate person / assasinate everyone / retrieve item / escape (undetected)

## Levels
More levels can be added, also with different rewards. 
If a level is especially difficult, then the reward can be a new weapon or a gem, or just a larger amount of coins.
Difficulty should increase exponentially between level, to ensure players need to buy new weapons.

## Items
Items can be added for another layer of gameplay. Items can be single use (or for 1 level), like: stat boosts items. 
There can also be items added inside levels like food, that fills the healthbar. 

# Warning
Fantasy elements can be added to the game, like: potions / elemental attacks / etc.

BUT make sure it's balanced. 
If magic attacks are added, players would likely be less incentivised to keep unlocking other types of weapons. 
Magic / Fantasy elements should thus only be added as one-time use items (or in later levels, maybe as weapon upgrates).
