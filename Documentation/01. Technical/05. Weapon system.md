Description

### Arrow
#### Methods
- `Start()`: Initializes the arrow's damage amount to 20f when the arrow object is created.
- `OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)`: Handles collision detection when the arrow enters a trigger area, dealing damage to enemies and destroying the arrow when it hits anything other than the player.

### Bow
#### Methods
- `Start()`: Initializes the bow's attack system by finding the parent's attack event and subscribing to it with the local Attack method.
- `FireArrow()`: Creates a new arrow projectile at the bow's offset position, matching the bow's rotation, and propels it forward using physics.
- `Attack()`: Triggers the attack coroutine when called, handling the timing and sequence of the bow's attack animation and arrow firing.
- `AttackCollision()`: Manages the bow's attack sequence, waiting for 0.5 seconds before firing an arrow, ensuring proper timing between animation and projectile creation.

### Sword
#### Methods
- `Start()`: Initializes the weapon's attack system by finding the parent's attack event and registering the weapon's attack handler.
- `Attack()`: Triggers the weapon's attack collision detection by starting the attack collision coroutine.
- `AttackCollision()`: Manages the weapon's collision detection by enabling the BoxCollider2D for 1 second, allowing it to detect hits during that time.

### Weapon
#### Methods
- `OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)`: Handles 2D physics collisions with other game objects, specifically checking for enemy collisions and applying damage through the `Health_Controller` component when contact is made.
