### GlobalManager

## Scene transitions
Description
### SceneController
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes the SceneController singleton pattern and sets up the scene fade component, ensuring only one instance exists across scene transitions.
-  `Start()`: Triggers the initial scene fade-in animation when the controller is first created.
-  `loadScene(int index)`: Initiates an asynchronous scene loading process with fade-out and fade-in transitions.
-  `OnSceneLoaded(Scene scene, LoadSceneMode mode)`: Handles scene loading completion by logging the loaded scene and triggering a fade-in animation.
-  `OnEnable()`: Subscribes to Unity's scene loaded event to track scene transitions.
-  `OnDisable()`: Unsubscribes from the scene loaded event when the controller is disabled.
-  `IEnumerator LoadSceneByIndex(int index)`: Coordinates the scene loading process, handling fade-out, scene loading, and fade-in transitions in sequence.
-  `GetSceneName()`: Returns the name of the currently active scene in the game.
### SceneFade
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes the scene fade system by getting a reference to the UI Image component that will be used for fading effects.
-  `FadeInCoroutine(float duration)`: Creates a fade-in effect by gradually reducing the opacity of the scene fade image from fully opaque to fully transparent over the specified duration, then deactivates the fade object.
-  `FadeOutCoroutine(float duration)`: Creates a fade-out effect by gradually increasing the opacity of the scene fade image from fully transparent to fully opaque over the specified duration, ensuring the fade object is active before starting.
-  `FadeCoroutine(Color startColor, Color targetColor, float duration)`: Handles the core fading logic, smoothly interpolating between the start and target colors over time using Unity's time delta for precise timing control.
### StartScene
#### Methods
-  `Start()`: Initializes the first scene so it also uses the scene transition.

## Scene classes

### CharacterBuilder
#### Methods
-  `Start()`: Initializes the shop UI by setting coin and gem amounts, updating shop item prices, and setting their visual states.
-  `EquipWeapon(string weapon)`: Equips the specified weapon through the WeaponManager singleton.
-  `Dashboard()`: Loads the dashboard scene (scene index 1) using the SceneController.
-  `SetCoinAmount()`: Updates the coin amount text display with the current value from the Wallet.
-  `SetGemAmount()`: Updates the gem amount text display with the current value from the Wallet.
-  `SetShopItemPrice()`: Initializes prices for all shop items through the GlobalManager.
-  `SetShopItemState()`: Updates the visual state of shop items (black for locked, white for unlocked).
-  `CheckIfWeaponCanBeEquipped(GameObject weapon)`: Checks if a weapon can be equipped and either equips it or shows a purchase popup.
-  `BuyItemWithCoins()`: Purchases the selected item using coins, updates the UI, and refreshes the coin display.
-  `BuyItemWithGems()`: Purchases the selected item using gems, updates the UI, and refreshes the gem display.
-  `PopupWindow(GameObject weapon)`: Displays a purchase confirmation popup with coin and gem price options, enabling/disabling buttons based on available funds.
### Dashboard
#### Methods
-  `Start()`: Initializes the dashboard by setting up reward text, level states, and quest information.
-  `CharacterBuilder()`: Navigates to the character builder scene (index 2) using the SceneController.
-  `DailyQuests()`: Displays the daily quests popup screen by enabling its GameObject.
-  `SetRewardText()`: Updates the reward text for each level by setting the reward amount and displaying it with a dollar sign prefix.
-  `Level1()`: Loads scene index 3 (Level 1) using the SceneController.
-  `Level2()`: Loads scene index 4 (Level 2) using the SceneController.
-  `IsLevelUnlocked(GameObject level)`: Checks if a level is unlocked by verifying if the previous level has been completed.
-  `SetLevelState()`: Updates the visual state of all levels by setting their images to black (locked) or white (unlocked).
-  `CheckIfLevelIsUnlocked(GameObject level)`: Loads the corresponding scene if the level is unlocked (white color).
-  `SetQuestInformation()`: Populates the GlobalManager's quest dictionary by extracting title, details, and reward information from quest GameObjects.
-  `QuestCleared(string questName)`: Notifies the GlobalManager that a quest has been completed.
