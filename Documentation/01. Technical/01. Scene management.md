## Management
Description

### GlobalManager
#### Methods
- `Awake()`: Implements the singleton pattern for GlobalManager, ensuring only one instance exists across scenes by checking if an instance already exists, creating a new one if needed, and preventing duplicates by destroying them.
- `GetRewardAmount(string sceneName)`: Returns the base reward amount for a specific scene, regardless of any modifications or multipliers.
- `SetRewardAmount(string sceneName)`: Initializes a new reward entry for a scene if it doesn't exist, setting its base reward value to the configured initial amount.
- `GetMaxReward(string sceneName)`: Returns the original base reward value for a scene before any reductions or modifications.
- `GetCurrentReward(string sceneName)`: Calculates and returns the current reward amount for a scene, taking into account any reductions based on the number of attempts made.
- `LessenReward(string sceneName)`: Reduces the reward multiplier for a scene based on the number of attempts, with the reduction percentage configured by _reductionPercentage.
- `AddAttempts(string sceneName)`: Increments the attempt counter for a specific scene, tracking how many times the player has tried it.
- `LevelStateChange(string sceneName)`: Marks a level as completed in the rewards system, typically called when the player successfully completes the level.
- `HasAttemptedLevel(string sceneName)`: Checks if the player has made any attempts at a specific level.
- `HasWonLevel(string sceneName)`: Verifies if a level has been successfully completed.
- `SetItemPrice(string itemName)`: Initializes a new shop item in the inventory system with the configured coin and gem prices if it doesn't already exist.
- `GetCurrentItemState(string itemName)`: Checks if a specific shop item has been unlocked or purchased.
- `BuyShopItemWithCoins(string itemName)`: Handles the purchase of a shop item using coins, deducting the cost from the player's wallet and unlocking the item if sufficient funds are available.
- `BuyShopItemWithGems(string itemName)`: Processes the purchase of a shop item using gems, deducting the gem cost from the player's wallet and unlocking the item if sufficient gems are available.
- `GetItemPrice(string itemName)`: Returns the coin cost of a specific shop item.
- `GetItemGemPrice(string itemName)`: Returns the gem cost of a specific shop item.
- `SetQuestInformationInDictionary(string questName, string title, string description, float reward)`: Creates a new quest entry with its details and reward value if it doesn't already exist.
- `ClearQuest(string questName)`: Marks a quest as completed and rewards the player with gems based on the quest's reward value.
- `GetGemReward(string questName)`: Returns the gem reward amount associated with a specific quest.

### LevelManager
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes the level by checking for a selected weapon and setting up the weapon state accordingly. If no weapon is selected, it defaults to "Empty" weapon configuration.
-  `InitializeLevel(string weapon)`: Manages weapon state by enabling the specified weapon and disabling all others. Uses the weapon name to find and toggle the corresponding GameObject's active state and component.
-  `Win()`: Handles level completion by adding coins to the player's wallet based on the current level's reward, marking the level as completed, and returning to the main scene.
-  `Lose()`: Manages level failure by reducing the level's reward value and returning to the main scene.

### WeaponManager
#### Methods
- `Awake()`: Implements the singleton pattern for WeaponManager, ensuring only one instance exists throughout the game session by checking for existing instances and preventing duplicates.
- `SelectWeapon(string weapon)`: Attempts to select a weapon by name, performing null checks and returning a boolean indicating success or failure while logging appropriate messages.
- `GetSelectedWeapon()`: Retrieves the currently selected weapon, returning null if no weapon is selected and logging a warning in that case.

## Scene transitions
Description

### SceneController
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes the SceneController singleton pattern and sets up the scene fade component, ensuring only one instance exists across scene transitions.
-  `Start()`: Triggers the initial scene fade-in animation when the controller is first created.
-  `loadScene(int index)`: Initiates an asynchronous scene loading process with fade-out and fade-in transitions.
-  `OnSceneLoaded(Scene scene, LoadSceneMode mode)`: Handles scene loading completion by logging the loaded scene and triggering a fade-in animation.
-  `OnEnable()`: Subscribes to Unity's scene loaded event to track scene transitions.
-  `OnDisable()`: Unsubscribes from the scene loaded event when the controller is disabled.
-  `IEnumerator LoadSceneByIndex(int index)`: Coordinates the scene loading process, handling fade-out, scene loading, and fade-in transitions in sequence.
-  `GetSceneName()`: Returns the name of the currently active scene in the game.

### SceneFade
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes the scene fade system by getting a reference to the UI Image component that will be used for fading effects.
-  `FadeInCoroutine(float duration)`: Creates a fade-in effect by gradually reducing the opacity of the scene fade image from fully opaque to fully transparent over the specified duration, then deactivates the fade object.
-  `FadeOutCoroutine(float duration)`: Creates a fade-out effect by gradually increasing the opacity of the scene fade image from fully transparent to fully opaque over the specified duration, ensuring the fade object is active before starting.
-  `FadeCoroutine(Color startColor, Color targetColor, float duration)`: Handles the core fading logic, smoothly interpolating between the start and target colors over time using Unity's time delta for precise timing control.

### StartScene
#### Methods
-  `Start()`: Initializes the first scene so it also uses the scene transition.

## Scene classes
Description

### CharacterBuilder
#### Methods
-  `Start()`: Initializes the shop UI by setting coin and gem amounts, updating shop item prices, and setting their visual states.

### Quest
#### Methods
