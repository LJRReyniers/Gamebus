## Scene transitions
### SceneController
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes the SceneController singleton pattern and sets up the scene fade component, ensuring only one instance exists across scene transitions.
-  `Start()`: Triggers the initial scene fade-in animation when the controller is first created.
-  `loadScene(int index)`: Initiates an asynchronous scene loading process with fade-out and fade-in transitions.
-  `OnSceneLoaded(Scene scene, LoadSceneMode mode)`: Handles scene loading completion by logging the loaded scene and triggering a fade-in animation.
-  `OnEnable()`: Subscribes to Unity's scene loaded event to track scene transitions.
-  `OnDisable()`: Unsubscribes from the scene loaded event when the controller is disabled.
-  `IEnumerator LoadSceneByIndex(int index)`: Coordinates the scene loading process, handling fade-out, scene loading, and fade-in transitions in sequence.
-  `GetSceneName()`: Returns the name of the currently active scene in the game.
### SceneFade
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes the scene fade system by getting a reference to the UI Image component that will be used for fading effects.
-  `FadeInCoroutine(float duration)`: Creates a fade-in effect by gradually reducing the opacity of the scene fade image from fully opaque to fully transparent over the specified duration, then deactivates the fade object.
-  `FadeOutCoroutine(float duration)`: Creates a fade-out effect by gradually increasing the opacity of the scene fade image from fully transparent to fully opaque over the specified duration, ensuring the fade object is active before starting.
-  `FadeCoroutine(Color startColor, Color targetColor, float duration)`: Handles the core fading logic, smoothly interpolating between the start and target colors over time using Unity's time delta for precise timing control.
### StartScene
#### Methods
-  `Start()`: Initializes the first scene so it also uses the scene transition.
