Description

### Player_Attack
#### Methods
- `Start()`: Initializes the attack system by retrieving the weapon type, setting up the attack input action, and creating a new UnityEvent for attack notifications.
- `Update()`: Manages the attack state by checking for attack button press, playing the appropriate weapon animation, triggering the attack event, and preventing multiple attacks until reset.
- `OnA(InputAction inputAction)`: Updates the attack button press state based on the current input action status.
- `CanAttack()`: Enables the ability to perform an attack by resetting the attack cooldown flag.

### Player_Damaged_Invincibility
#### Methods
- `Awake()`: Gets a reference to the `Invincibility_Controller` component attached to the same GameObject using Unity's GetComponent system.
- `StartInvincibility()`: Initiates the invincibility effect by calling the corresponding method on the `Invincibility_Controller`, passing in the duration, flash color, and number of flashes parameters.

### Player_Movement
#### Methods
- `Awake()`: Initializes the Rigidbody2D component reference when the object is created.
- `FixedUpdate()`: Updates the player's physics state by handling movement and rotation calculations during the physics update cycle.
- `SetPlayerVelodity()`: Sets the player's linear velocity based on input direction and speed, controlling the player's movement.
- `RotateInDirectionOfInput()`: Rotates the player object towards the movement input direction using smooth rotation interpolation.
- `OnMove(InputValue inputValue)`: Captures and stores movement input from the player's controls.
