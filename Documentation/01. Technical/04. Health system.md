Description

### Health_Bar_UI
#### Methods
- `UpdateHealthBar(Health_Controller health_Controller)`: Updates the visual representation of a health bar by setting its fill amount to match the current health percentage of the provided `health controller`.

### Health_Controller
#### Methods
- `TakeDamage(float damageAmount)`: Reduces the entity's health by the specified amount, handling invincibility, death state, and triggering appropriate events.
- `AddHealth(float amountToAdd)`: Increases the entity's health by the specified amount, ensuring it doesn't exceed the maximum health value.

### Invincibility_Controller
#### Methods
- `Awake()`: Initializes the invincibility controller by getting references to the `Health_Controller` and `Sprite_Flash` components.
- `StartInvincibility(float invincibilityDuration, Color flashColour, int numberOfFlashes)`: Initiates the invincibility effect with specified duration, flash color, and number of flashes.
- `InvincibilityCoroutine(float invincibilityDuration, Color flashColour, int numberOfFlashes)`: Manages the invincibility state and visual effects, making the character invulnerable while displaying a flashing effect, then restoring normal state when complete.

### Sprite_Flash
#### Methods
- `Awake()`: Initializes the sprite renderer reference by finding the first SpriteRenderer component in the current game object or its children.
- `FlashCoroutine(float flashDuration, Color flashColour, int numberOfFlashes)`: Creates a flashing effect on the sprite by smoothly transitioning between its original color and the specified flash color, repeating the specified number of times over the given duration.
