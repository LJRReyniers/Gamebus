Description

### Enemy_Attack
#### Methods
- `OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)`: Handles 2D physics collisions between the enemy and other game objects, specifically checking for player contact and applying damage when appropriate.

### Enemy_Movement
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Initializes essential components by getting references to the Rigidbody2D and Player_Awareness_Controller, and creates an array to store obstacle collision data.
-  `FixedUpdate()`: Coordinates the enemy's movement system by updating direction, handling rotation, and setting velocity in a fixed time step.
-  `UpdateTargetDirection()`: Determines the enemy's movement direction based on player awareness state, either following the player or moving in no direction, and triggers obstacle avoidance checks.
-  `HandleObstacles()`: Implements obstacle avoidance by casting a circle in front of the enemy, detecting collisions, and adjusting movement direction to avoid obstacles when detected.
-  `RotateTowardsTarget()`: Rotates the enemy towards its target direction using smooth rotation, ensuring the enemy faces its movement direction.
-  `SetVelocity()`: Controls the enemy's movement speed based on whether it has a valid target direction, moving at full speed when directed or stopping when directionless.

### Player_Awareness_Controller
#### Methods
-  `Awake()`: Finds and stores a reference to the player's transform component when the script is initialized.
-  `Update()`: Calculates the direction to the player and updates the awareness state based on distance.
